# Frontend Code Test
**HTML** - Can be plain HTML, JavaScript template literals or you can use a template library.

**CSS** - Use a pre-processor, whichever you feel most comfortable with.

**JavaScript** - Use only vanilla JavaScript, you can use whichever modern standards you like, however, no libraries or frameworks except if you want to use a template library for above.

Replicate **design.png** in the design folder as best you can, and populate it with **code-test.json** found in the **json** folder.

**Github** - Commit this to your own public Github account, with regular commits including descriptions. Your final code should be hosted on Github, displaying a live version along with the original source code.
